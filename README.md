# dotfiles

## _Another dotfiles repo?!_

Short answer: Yes.

I always wanted my own dotfiles and here is where they live. Feel free to fork this repository and adapt everything to your own needs in case you could use something from this.

## _Purpose_

The first intention was simply to have my own dotfiles where I could do whatever I want. Mainly I try to build a structure out of folders where you simply need to drop a textfile with some contents without any further hacking. Drop it, use it, love it.

## _Notes_

At the moment it barely fullfills everything I envision but it's already a solid base to build upon.
