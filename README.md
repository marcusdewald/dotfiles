# dotfiles

## _Another dotfiles repo?_

Short answer: Yes.

I always wanted my dotfiles and here is where they live. Feel free to fork this repository and adapt everything to your own needs in case you could use something from this.

## _Purpose_

The first intention was to have my dotfiles where I could do whatever I want. Mainly I try to build a structure out of folders where you need to drop a text file with some contents without any further hacking. Drop it, use it, love it.

## _Notes_

It is tested and developed on macOS with iTerm2 and ZSH as Bash replacement.
At the moment it barely fulfills everything I envision, but it's already a solid base.
